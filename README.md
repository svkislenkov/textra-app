Textra is a small student project that sends user-requested reminder and notification messages.
All messages are fully opt-in, low volume, and non-marketing.

How It Works

A user provides their phone number through the Textra web form.
That action serves as explicit opt-in consent.
The app sends only the reminders or notifications the user configured.
Users can opt out anytime by replying STOP.
Users can reply HELP for help.

Messaging Policy

No marketing, promotional, political, or unsolicited content.
Message frequency varies based on the reminders the user sets.
All data is used only to send the messages the user requested.
Phone numbers are never sold or shared.
Data deletion is available upon request.
